## 🧪 Machine Learning Models

### 🩺 Breast Cancer Detection
- **Dataset**: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (sklearn)
- **Features**: 30 computed features from cell nuclei
- **Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- **Accuracy**: ~97% on test data

### 🍭 Diabetes Prediction
- **Dataset**: PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset
- **Features**: Glucose, BMI, Age, Blood Pressure, etc.
- **Model**: Support Vector Machine (Linear Kernel)
- **Accuracy**: ~78% on test data

All models are trained, validated, and saved as `.pkl` files using joblib for efficient real-time predictions.
